* **Features on the app:**
    The app first shows users a life counter starting at 20. The life counter can be incremented or decremented by 1 or by a custom amount. Below the life counter, there is a button to roll a D20 dice which is often needed while playing the game of Magic the Gathering. Any user can also search through the entire MTG database of cards to get a closer look at any card of their choice or have random card presented to them. If users decide to register an account, they are able to favorite cards to add to a collection which can be viewed at any time while logged in.
